# Contributing to WHY Console

Thank you for wanting to contribute to this **meaningless, yet important** project!

## How to contribute?

1. **Pick a language** – if your favorite programming language isn’t here yet, create a folder for it under `/console/` (e.g., `/console/rust`).
2. **Write the code** – the program must simply print:
3. **Submit a PR** – send your code as a pull request, following the project's structure.
4. **Wait for approval** – if your code outputs "why" without unnecessary distractions, it will be accepted.

## Rules

- The code must be **minimalistic**. No extra lines, no comments, just `why`.
- Maintain **proper structure** – a new folder for a new language, with the code inside it.
- If the language has multiple ways to print `why`, choose the shortest and most elegant one.

## Why?

Yes.
